Basic Setup:

Open webpack-server-boilerplate” in vscode
npm init -y
create .gitignore and add:
node_modules
dist

In package.json, replace all text with:
"private": true, 
"scripts": {
    "watch": "webpack --watch",
    "start": "webpack serve --open",
    "build": "webpack"
  },


"start": "webpack"

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli @babel/preset-env babel-loader @babel/core webpack-dev-server
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli @babel/preset-env babel-loader @babel/core webpack-dev-server css-loader style-loader clean-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin html-loader mini-css-extract-plugin file-loader npm install --save-dev optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin webpack-merge
npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader
npm install --save-dev lodash
npm install --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
0npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
npm install --save-dev html-loader
npm install file-loader --save-dev

npm run build
npm start


import { camelCase } from ‘lodash’


"scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server  --config webpack.dev.js --open",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js"
  },











Notes:
- You actually could do all your imports without webpack but you would have to use tons of imports and you would have to instantiate them in
exactly the correct order. It would be a massive pain 
- The entry point for your program is specified in package.json. By default it will look in ./src/index.js
- You can define the entry point in package.json but this only defines the file, not the path
- If you want to change the file path it looks in you have to do that in the config file
- Your package.json and config should point to the same entry 
- using mode: development with devtool: false makes your bundle readable and splits it onto separate lines for debugging
- You can change your output or input by changing it in config 
- The mode: development field makes bundle.js more readable 
- Loaders are used to tell javascript how to handle different file types 
- Loaders transpile different file types down to be understood by javascript
- If you want to use your css file inside of other files you need to import it to index.js
- css loader takes your css and turns it into javascript, style loader takes that css-javascript and puts it into the dom 
- sass is like a more advanced version of css (it's just a css extension)
- You still have to load your ./main/css file, you just load it from index.js rather than your html 
- Actually this is only true until you start hashing stuff. The htmlwebpack plugin means you dont import anything from ./main
- Remember, there is no css or html in your final javascript on the server. Everything is converted to javascript then run 
- Caching is when your browser remembers stuff. If you run a program the first time the server will take from the file location. If you
refresh the page the browser will take the file from it's own file it just created locally (since it assumes the file hasn't changed). This
is called caching 
- The problem with this is that if a user calls your program on their browser, goes away from three days and calls it again then the browser
will still just use it's cached file. That means even if the dev have updated the file the user will only see the cached version of the file 
from three days ago 
- You fix this using cache busting. This means that every time the dev updates the file the file name on the serve will change slightly so the
user will call the correct version 
- You run cache busting by writing filename[contentHash].js e.g.'bundle.[contentHash].js'
- The problem with cache busting is that you can no longer call your bundle.js script from your html (since the name of bundle.js is hashed
every time the browser runs)
- You fix this with plugins - htmlwebpack plugin fixes this
- When you are using htmlwebpack, you put your index.html into a template and then in your config file tell your plugin to use that template
- This also means you no longer have to import js through <script>. Instead the plugin takes care of this for you 
- If you look at index.html in dist folder, the <script> will now call the hashed version of bundle
- The point of your build folder is that it contains absolutely everything you need to run your server. All your css, javascript, images, everything
- Images also get hashbusted
- Use html loader to put images in dist
- file loader converts files like images to javascript and puts them in the dist folder. This means you don't need to import them 
- Clean webpack deletes the dist build and remakes it every time you load the webpage
- This ensure that you don't have a massive build up of hashed dist files in your directory
